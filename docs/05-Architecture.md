## File Layout

We are loosely based of the [Bullet Proof React Project Structure](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md)

## Extra Resources!

- [Clean Code Javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)
- [Naming Cheatsheet](https://github.com/kettanaito/naming-cheatsheet)

## Technologies

The list of technologies we will use to build the application is as follows:

| ---------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| [MongoDB]  | [Database]          | [3.6.5]   |
