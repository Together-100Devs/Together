# Description

Moved the pull request template file from `docs/pull_request_template.md` to `.github/pull_request_template.md`.  
Additionally, updated the template content to include a proper issue reference using the `Resolves #[issue]` keyword, which enables automatic issue closing by GitHub when the PR is merged.

This improves contributor guidance and ensures better integration with GitHubâ€™s automation for issue tracking.
